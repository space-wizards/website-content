Two new science technologies can be researched on the station, the first of which are jump boots. These allow the user to traverse potentially lethal surfaces with ease, no power required. The second is the harmpack; this backpack allows the users to enjoy two extra functional arms, for whatever purposes you may have! Artifact glue can allow for endless riches or destruction to whatever artifact the glue is applied to. The spray painter now allows for tile perfect decals, alongside other various options. As well as various other content pieces, sprite works, and awesome bug fixes in this patch cycle.
