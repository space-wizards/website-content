A new station joins the game; it is named Exo. This station features alien architecture, different department layouts, and other stylized choices. A new syndicate weapon named the Estoc is a longer-range option, with not quite as much stopping power as the C20 or Bulldog. Thieving gloves were removed, meaning now only the thief antag can steal from people quickly and stealthily. Scrap armor allows for tiders to make discount blood-reds, and now mad scientists can turn you into a smart corgi!
