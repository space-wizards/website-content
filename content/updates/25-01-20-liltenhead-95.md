Two new maps were added to the game. Plasma, a medium population station, is a unique map that features plasma pools, a lot of asteroid rocks, and unusual hallway designs not found in other stations. In theme with the map, the TEG is the primary power method of the station. The second map is known as Elkridge. This is a low population map with a cozy design and a few unique takes on areas like the bridge. There were also a bunch of nice QoL and minor additions added, from being able to print out bedsheets to ordering large instruments. Radiator pipes can now be crafted in a bent variety, and air sensor settings can now be copied with just a click of a button.
