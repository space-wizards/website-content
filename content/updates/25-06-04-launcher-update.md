Minor fixes and localization updates.

<!--more-->

*This concerns the game launcher used to connect to game servers. Updates for game content happens separately.*

* Attempt to fix a date parsing issue that could cause the launcher to brick.
* Server search now doesn't update on every character entered to avoid lag.
* Added Italian and Norwegian Bokm√•l translation.
* Updated the localization files.

This update will be made available on all platforms as soon as possible. For manual downloads, [get them here](https://github.com/space-wizards/SS14.Launcher/releases).
