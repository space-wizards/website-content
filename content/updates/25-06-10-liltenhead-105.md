Atmos techs can now layer multiple pipes on the same tile and even combine them into one singular output. This offers the previous complex systems of pipe stacking while still looking great. You can now highlight any words you want, from your name to your current job. This will allow you to stay more focused on things pertaining to you, especially helpful in busy radio situations. Sentry turrets, like the ones found in AI cores, will now have consoles to configure their settings further. Diona can now "root" into the ground, allowing them to walk over slippery surfaces while absorbing whatever reagents lie below. There are other great QoL features, from evac emergency lockers to improved atmos devices.
