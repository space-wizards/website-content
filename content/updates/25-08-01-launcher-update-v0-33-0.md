Updater improvements and localization updates.

<!--more-->

*This concerns the game launcher used to connect to game servers. Updates for game content happens separately.*

* When downloading server content, the launcher will now persist downloaded files even if the process is interrupted. This also means downloads can be properly resumed, and should be a great improvement for people with shoddy internet connections.
* Added Hungarian and Esperanto translation.
* Updated the localization files.

This update will be made available on all platforms as soon as possible. For manual downloads, [get them here](https://github.com/space-wizards/SS14.Launcher/releases).
