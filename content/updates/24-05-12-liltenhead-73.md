This week brings loads of new features and content additions. Impactful ghost roles like ninjas or dragons now have a raffle before the role is given out. This gives all players interested in the role an equally random chance of obtaining the role once the timer ends. Space dragons can breathe fire now, ninjas have a new objective, and emagged cyborgs are more stealthy. Also this week, bullets will now pass over critically injured mobs unless you aim directly at them. Random shuttles with distinct passengers may now arrive randomly as a mid-round event. The robotics console allows scientists to destroy potentially misbehaving borgs and much more over the course of the week.
