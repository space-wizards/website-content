Scurrets make their first appearance on the station. They are a ghost role that is purchasable for 25k spesos. Currently they are only for emotional support. A new Atmos device was added that allows technicians even greater control over the pressure in their networks. Most syndicate hardsuits now feature some level of stamina resistance, giving them greater power over stun weaponry. There have been sweeping tweaks across salvage, generally nerfing all of their weaponry while simultaneously debuffing their foes.
