This is normally more elaborate, but I'm tired. You put healy stuff in fridge, fridge dispenses stuff, life good. Wizard den is real; a wizard lives there and teleports out. Advanced reagents work slower, reagents in smoke and foam react differently. You can crawl now, or slip into a crawl. Crawling has combat benefits in compact situations, but can make you an easier target. Crawling also allows you to pick up stuff while worming around.
