## FAQ

#### What about 32-bit support?

32-bit (x86) is not supported. All modern CPUs are 64-bit, there is no reason for us to continue supporting 32-bit.

#### Is Apple Silicon supported?

Apple Silicon machines (M1, M2, M3, ...) are supported through Rosetta 2. While this does not provide optimal performance and battery life, it is totally playable. Proper support for Apple Silicon will probably happen some time.

#### What about ARM?

ARM is currently supported for Linux servers but nowhere else.

#### What about Windows 7 and Windows 8?

Windows 7 and 8 are out of support from Microsoft. Due to changes in various components we use such as the .NET runtime it is impossible for us to keep supporting them. Please upgrade to Windows 10 or switch to Linux if you are using one of these operating systems.

#### Is there a difference between the Steam version and non-Steam version?

Not currently. In the future we plan to add Steam-specific features such as automatic login with your Steam account, but there's currently no difference.
