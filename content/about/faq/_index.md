# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is It Cursed?

A: Nah.

### Q: What Language/Engine is SS14 written in?

A: It's written in C# using a hand made engine, RobustToolbox. C# is a good language and it's pretty much perfect for the project. It's quite fast but also very comfortable to write.

### Q: Can I Help?

A: Sure you can. Hop on Discord or IRC and look at GitHub and our [HackMD Wiki](https://hackmd.io/@ss14/docs/%2FvJp0-PyuSNeWMb5GA00B4Q). We love new coders and will always answer questions and provide coding help!

### Q: Are you Unitystation?

A: No. Unitystation is a completely different project with it's own design decisions, goals, and runs on an entirely different engine.

### Q: Will SS14 Support Multiple Codebases?

A: It already does! If you're looking to start your own SS14 codebase fork the [content repo](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) and read the [getting started](https://hackmd.io/@ss14/docs/%2FBZkI4RlUQbm09QWrXCZ3kg) guide.

### Q: Is There a Patreon? Can I donate?

A: [Yes.](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) We started a Patreon in order to pay for productivity software, server hosting, work commissions, and more! In addition to providing rewards, we will also regularly post a financial statement that shows how our income is being used in the game's development. We want to give our patrons full trust and confidence, and we believe that being 100% transparent about how the money is being used is best.

### Q: Where can I play SS14?

A: You can download SS14 right now from our website, or wait for our free Steam release which we estimate will come out in Fall of 2020.
