### Nuclear Operatives
*Contributed by PaulRitter & metalgearsloth*

The Nanotrasen Quarterly Threat Assessment™ has been published, and it seems the Syndicate are now employing Nuclear Operatives hell-bent on blowing stations back to the Stone Age. All Nanotrasen facilities are advised to be on alert and to neutralize these operatives with extreme prejudice. Additionally, Captains are instructed to ensure the location and safety of the Nuclear Authentication Disk at all times.

### Secret
*Contributed by moony & metalgearsloth*

With Nuke Ops comes Secret, the new (to SS14) default mode that doesn't tell you who or what the antags are, or if there's any at all to begin with.

Secret's true mode can be influenced by weighing modes differently, requiring certain conditions such as minimum/maximum players, and more.

Not immediately knowing what antagonist to counter should spice up the rounds nicely.

### Station Alert Levels
*Contributed by vulppine & Morb0*

Code Red! All hands on deck! Battlestations!

That's right, the communications console can now designate a station's alert level, thus keeping the crew informed of how fearful they should be for their lives. Central Command also has access to even higher tiers of alert level. In the event of a Delta or Epsilon alert, please pray to your deity of choice or hide in the nearest available fridge.

### Console Command Completion
*Contributed by PJB*

There is now a system for console command completions. Completions are easy enough to write, and a decent chunk of commands already have them.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/console" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Redial
*Contributed by 20kdc*

Previously, when the server updated or restarted, players would have to close the game and reconnect from the launcher. While the restart of the game still needs to happen (due to needing to update the client as well), it has now been automated - the restart occurs simply by the press of a button.

### New Parallax
*Contributed by DogZeroX*

Astronomers are baffled after noticing that space looks completely different from how it did yesterday, but many agree that the new look is much prettier.

### Suppermatter
*Contributed by PJB*

One of the most common engines has finally arrived... in the form of a delicious and energy-rich meal! ...What?

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/suppermatter" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Magic Spellbook
*Contributed by keronshb*

The Department of Occult Affairs has stumbled across a genuine magic spellbook capable of feats such as teleportation, creating magical barriers, summoning creatures, and more. Crewmembers are advised to be on the lookout for runes and other mystical shenanigans.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_35/blink.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Flavortext
*Contributed by Veritius*

Crewmembers can now provide a short description of any not-readily-apparent physical characteristics or any other aspects they wish to describe about themselves.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/flavortext" >}}

If you intend to abuse this opportunity, refer to the section immediately below this one.

{{< newsection >}}
### New Smites
*Contributed by moony*

Admins now have access to twenty-one (21) new smites for applying *creative punishments* to crewmembers that don't quite earn a ban. Rather than go through all of them, we're just going to leave you with a picture containing most of the smite icons and let you work out for yourself what these fresh hells might entail. Don't get yourself banished to the chess dimension.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/smite" >}}

### Space Ambience
*Contributed by ike709*

It turns out sound *does* travel in the vacuum of space, and it's full of beats to relax to as you drift through the endless void waiting for your oxygen to run out! Below is only a short preview, but you can listen to the two full tracks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTfPEFfmhrA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwRj1LI3aw).

### Rebalanced Space Damage
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404 & juliangiebel*

Due to the high fatality rate of unprotected EVAs and hull breaches—and more importantly the cost of cloning replacement crew—Central Command has retooled the genetic makeup of crewmembers to ensure a minimum of one (1) minute of unprotected survivability in the harsh vacuum of space.

Additionally, there's a new medipen in survival boxes to help with space exposure and some emergency lockers now contain emergency suits.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/eva" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Nanotrasen Interns
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

Someone informed HR about the concept of unpaid interns, so all entry-level employees have been ~~demoted~~ reassigned to the new role of departmental interns. They'll be paid in experience, and if they delivering enough coffee to their superiors they'll be promoted to full employees in no time.

The four new jobs include:

- Technical Assistant (Engineering)
- Medical Intern (Medical)
- Service Worker (Service)
- Security Cadet (Security)

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/interns" >}}

Additionally, Assistants have been demoted to Passengers. We both know they weren't actually assisting anyone.

{{< newsection >}}
### Polymorphs & Transformation
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

It's a bird... It's a mouse... It's... a crewmember? Entities are now capable of transforming into different entities and back to their original form, unless of course an admin smites you.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_35/polymorph.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Immovable Rod
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

All stations have a new hazard to be on the lookout for, the Immovable Rod. It'll go through a station like a pulse rifle through a greyshirt, so try not to cross paths with any.

And remember—the rod is immovable, the rest of the universe is what's moving. Pray that it never encounters an unstoppable force.

{{< video-auto "/video/pr_35/rod.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Random Metadata
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

Variety is the spice of life, and as such it's now possible for things to have random names or descriptions. You won't believe all the things ATV can stand for.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/atv" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Industrial & Advanced Welders
*Contributed by Peptide90*

Engineers have some new welders that they can occasionally find in their lockers or on salvage wrecks: The Industrial Welder with a 250u fuel tank and the Advanced Industrial Welder which is 1.3x faster.

The total range of welders is shown below and goes from left to right: Experimental, Advanced Industrial, Industrial, Standard, Mini (Emergency)

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/welders" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Skeletons
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

To alleviate ongoing labor shortages, Central Command has began experimenting with using necromancy on deceased crewmembers. They are resilient against various environmental hazards, but susceptible to physical trauma and may fall apart. Skeletons in such a state will need to be reassembled by hand.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/mandalore" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Cat Ears
*Contributed by Peptide90*

OwO what's this? (Author's Note: Never writing that again...) Traitors can now waste their telecrystals on a set of cat ears. Alternatively, it can be rarely found as loot. Side effects of wearing cat ears include being forced to talk like an idiot.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/cat" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Extended Access
*Contributed by PJB*

Central Command acknowledges that doing your job can be a bit harder on undercrewed stations, and in such cases your ID cards will have additional access enabled to make your job easier.

For example, when extended access is in effect the Botanist will have Kitchen access and Medical Doctors will have Chemistry access added on top of their normal access.

{{< newsection >}}
### New Crates
*Contributed by youarereadingthis, magmodius, Peptide90, Macoron, lapatison, & keronshb*

Cargo has received a manifest of new crates available for order, including:
- Shuttle Assembly Crate
- Electronics Crate
- Mice Crate
- Kitchen Supplies Crate

Rumor has it that the Syndicate are now offering their agents the chance to buy surplus crates, with random gear at extremely reduced prices.

Additionally, after a few lawsuits the latches on crates have been loosened a bit and will now allow trapped crewmembers to resist out of them.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/crates" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Markings
*Contributed by vulppine & DogZeroX*

In an effort to improve morale, Central Command has relaxed the dress code policy to allow various tattoos, extrusions, and other markings on ~~company property~~ employees' bodies.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/markings" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Wires Refactor
*Contributed by vulppine*

All engineers are advised that a new, ~~cheaper~~ more efficient circuit board supplier has resulted in doors and potentially other machines becoming much more dangerous and more varied in wire functionality. Wires can also shock anyone who touches them without insulated gloves. Additionally, cutting a door's power wire now causes it to become electrified and extremely dangerous until a multitool is used to reset the door's power.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_35/wires.mp4" >}}

### Better Spacewind, Removed Spacewind
*Contributed by Tomeno & DogZeroX*

Explosive decompression, also known as space wind, flows a bit differently now and should generally yeet people in the direction of pressure differentials, as shown in the video below. It's a lot more realistic and makes more sense than the existing algorithm.

However... Space wind has also been entirely disabled for the time being pending further changes. This is a config option, so other servers can reenable it if they wish and take advantage of the improved yeeting showcased in this video.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_35/wind.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Round Start & End Audio
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

Some audio changes have been made to round start/end, including:
- An audio ping now denotes that the round is starting, so you know it's time to Alt+Tab from Reddit or whatever
- Lobby music will play again at round-end (unless disabled in audio settings)
- APC destroyed mission accomplished

{{< newsection >}}
### Combat Changes
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

The new Employee Defensive Combat Training Initiative™ has rolled out some new policies for its hand-to-hand combat training. Crewmembers will now perform a direct attack when directly hitting something, and will wide-attack in other circumstances.

{{< video-auto "/video/pr_35/combat.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Power Monitoring Console
*Contributed by 20kdc*

The Engineering Department has received a new console to monitor both power sources and loads. No more excuses for generating insufficient power or accidentally disconnecting all of the SMES units!

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/monitor" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Power Sink
*Contributed by Veritius*

The Syndicate have provided traitors with another tool from SS13, the power sink. This bad boy can drain up to 300 kW and then goes out with a bang.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_35/sink" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Speech Noises
*Contributed by hubismal*

Central Command noticed that crewmembers and vending machines didn't actually make any audible sounds when speaking, and this... deficiency... has now been rectified.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_35/speech.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Typing Indicator
*Contributed by Macoron*

Central Command has noted a 30% decrease in awkward conversations after the addition of chat bubbles, which now pop up when someone is typing.

## Mapping
### Waystation
*Contributed by Timrod*

Waystation, a map originally from /vg/station, has been recreated in SS14 to replace Packed Station as a low/mid pop map.

## Technical
### Client Profiling System
*Contributed by PJB*

I wrote a simple log-based profiling system, with the intent of making it easier to help weed out stutters and other performance issues. The internal data stored is extremely simple, so performance overhead at runtime is absolutely minimal. Profiles are viewed in the pop-out developer window, to avoid cluttering the main game. It’s not the most advanced tool, but it was certainly fun to write.
