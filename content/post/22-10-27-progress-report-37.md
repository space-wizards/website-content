## Content
### Three-Parter
This progress report only covers July 2022. The August and September 2022 editions will follow shortly after it.

{{< newsection >}}
### Botsplosion
*Contributed by Rane*

Security reports that a variety of medibots, cleanbots, and more were smuggled aboard the latest cargo shuttle resupply. They have offered to overlook this unfortunate mishap in exchange for a cleanbot to remove ~~bloodstains~~ trash from holding cells.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/bots" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Identity & Disguises
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

After several successful implantations of telepathic inhibitors, crewmembers are now able to disguise their identity from each other by hiding IDs, covering their faces, and so on.

Crewmembers are discouraged from engaging in any anonymous tomfoolery or criminal activity.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/identity" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Magic Staves & Wands
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

The Wizard Federation has begun supplying a new arsenal of magic staves and wands to its agents. In the event that you are spontaneously turned into a magic fish, please report to Security for immediate termination.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_37/wand.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Damage Masks
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

Taking damage now comes with more visual feedback in the form of damage overlays.

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_37/damage_mask.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Disease Stages
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

CentCom Virologists have released a new disease classification system, splitting up disease effects and cures into unique stages based on disease progression.

Generally speaking, earlier stages have milder symptoms and are more easily treatable, so crewmembers are advised to report to medical ASAP if they feel more sickly and disgusting than usual.

{{< newsection >}}
### Movement Refactor
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

Movement has been refactored, resulting in a variety of code cleanup, tweaks, and improvements. The most obvious player-facing change is that vehicles are now predicted and should generally feel more responsive. Vehicles also have acceleration now, so the laws of physics should be slightly less violated.

Additionally, shuttles can now brake (spacebar) and have separate keys for strafing and rotating.

{{< newsection >}}
### Portable Scrubbers
*Contributed by Rane*

Atmospherics has received a shipment of portable scrubbers. It should now be easier to make a room habitable again after acts of ~~sabotage~~ ~~incompetence~~ accidental gas release.

{{< video-auto "/video/pr_37/scrubber.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Shuttle FTL
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

All shuttle navigation computers have received an update which, among other things, enables more shuttles to FTL to CentCom in an emergency.

Please be advised that the navigation data may have been intercepted by a hostile Syndicate planet.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/nukieplanet" "50%" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Stamina
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

<!-- description doesnt make it very clear what was changed -->
After a series of lawsuits, crewmembers are no longer perpetually amped up on epinephrine and amphetamines; instead, everyone is now susceptible to stamina damage!

Work on your dodging skills or disabler beams will have you stunned in no time, but you're no longer prone to falling over from a single shot of a taser.

{{< video-auto "/video/pr_37/stun.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Sleeping & Blinding
*Contributed by Rane*

As a result of the aforementioned stamina changes and lawsuits, crewmembers are now permitted to sleep as needed.

To help crewmembers in this endeavor, a supply of ~~blindfolds~~ sleep masks have been issued to all stations. Blindfolds can be acquired from Security by pretending to be able to shoot lasers from your eyes. Crewmembers that can *actually* shoot lasers from their eyes are advised to report to Medical as soon as possible.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/sleep" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Blocking & Shields
*Contributed by keronshb*

Security has received a new shipment of riot shields, which have the ability to Block™ incoming attacks. This should hopefully be self-explanatory, but blocking attacks is encouraged whenever possible to mitigate incoming damage.

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/shields" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Boxers (Not the Underwear)
*Contributed by Rane*

One of the first station-restricted jobs has been added: Crewmembers can now join as the Boxer aboard Lighthouse Station.

*"It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!” - Rocky Balboa*

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/boxer" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Event Music
*Contributed by ike709*

Events can now play lofi hip hop beats to relax/study/die horribly to. As an example, sick tunes will now play when the nuclear device is armed. There's a short preview below but you can listen to the full thing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gVAPKlgqA).

{{< video-audio "/video/pr_37/nuke.mp4" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Frezon
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

Atmospherics has received approval to begin producing and deploying Frezon, a new gas with a variety of effects such as:

- Rapidly cooling/depressurizing rooms and suppressing fires
- Reacting with nitrogen to form nitrous oxide
- Reacting with miasma to make *lots* of miasma
- Getting high*

*Nanotrasen waives all responsibility for any brain damage resulting from Frezon™ inhalation

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/frezon" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Zombies Game Mode
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

*BRAAAAAAAAAINS...*

{{< imgw "/images/post/pr_37/zombie" >}}

{{< newsection >}}
### Antagonist Menu
*Contributed by drakewill-CRL*

Admins have a new tool full of potential for ~~abuse~~ enhancing the round—the antag menu! At the click of a button anybody can be turned into a traitor, nuke op, or any other wacky antagonist role.
